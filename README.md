This is code for one of the first trap beats I made in Sonic Pi (Feb. 2018).
There are many things I would do differently now if I tried to remake this beat but this is the original code.

In order for this code to work, you must download the audio sample files onto your own computer and replace the path to those files' directory accordingly in your own code. The variables for these files are:
gak = processed 10.wav<br> 
fire = fireworks c1.wav<br>
vox = voice C2.wav


The drum sounds have multiple files in each folder while the other samples are each one single audio file. The drum sounds are a part of an 808 drum sample packet that I downloaded for free at: https://soundpacks.com/free-sound-packs/808-drum-kit/
